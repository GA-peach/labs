# Behavioral Objective

By now, you should have an idea about who is your primary user is for your case study. They can be a subset of a larger, broadly relevant or strategic group, but focused toward a more modest opportunity for success. For example, if you are broadly interested in reaching people that are planning to get a pet, and you have a broader objective to promote pet adoption over buying pets from a store, you may want to focus on those people who are visiting a particular shelter page. Your target user may be those users most receptive to making such a decision.

Take a look at this ad about foster care (humans and not pets). https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3C7rX-iKygA

This video is trying to reach a population of potential foster parents who are concerned that they may not be good enough to be foster parents. The strategic population are the pool of potential foster parents. And the primary audience are *those who are concerned that they are not good enough.* 

So what is the intent of this video? It's objective is behavioral - it is a **call to action**.

Your behavioral objective is the action you want the user to make and involves some sort of **decision making** whether to push a button to ask for more information, completion of a task with multiple steps, or simply engaging for some period of time in sustained "conversation". Your objective must be quantifiable. Can you count button presses, sign-ups, task completions, time on site, number of visits, etc.? We'll talk more about how to quantify behavior change later. For now, consider the context for action and decision points for your user.
