# Insight

An insight is simply *deep understanding* or a *truth*. It creates an *opportunity* for design and a *connection* for your users. Often, it's derived from "insider knowledge" about your user. Later in the course we'll talk about habits. Where we can tap into habits or practice (or processes by which you engage your user), you'll have potential opportunities to guide behavior.

Last week, you watched the video ["The nightmare videos of childrens' YouTube â€” and what's wrong with the internet today"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9EKV2nSU8w) presented by James Bridle. His insight came from thinking about how an algorithm worked versus a user. Nonetheless, his story was effective. Why is that?

First, what insights could you have derived from his talk:

- Abundance of highly accessible meaningless, addictive (ear-wormy) videos that reel children in without clear motive randomly assembled by... software??
- The real audience is software that has an algorithm selecting for these videos.
- Auto-play has the pernicious effect of propagating and making more viral and more potentially risky and dangerous to children.
- Monetization of attention?

As to why his story is so effective, consider the **contrast** between harmless un-wrapping of chocolate eggs to the potential danger posed to children when exposed to these videos.

A video that may better illustrate the importance of insight derived from users is a talk presented by Kathryn Schultz called ["On Being Wrong](https://www.ted.com/talks/kathryn_schulz_on_being_wrong/transcript)." Not only does she beautifully illustrate how wrong we can be when we don't consider the views of our users (hence the importance of research methods such as ethnography), but she illustrates another powerful sort of story: *they thought this one thing was going to happen and then something else happened instead*. There is both authenticity in such a story -- and also surprise. And while this takes us off the topic of insight, consider how well your audience will remember your story and also be swayed by it.
