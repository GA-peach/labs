## Case Study Design

- Narrative focused on a small user population (nail this down)
- Think about whether you can do any ethnographic research
- You have broad goals - now consider a concrete situation and a short list of points to address
- No design solutions yet!

Note:

We haven't really spoken about what a case study is yet. You got an idea of how to formulate the problem and then frame a nudge from [the nudge blog](http://nudges.org/2011/09/21/a-devious-little-marketing-nudge/) and  [dozen nudges](https://nudges.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/our-dozen-nudges1.pdf). From this, you inferred something about how persuasion, as well. (we'll get into this in much more depth during the semester.)

Case Studies are another useful tool. They are applied often in the social sciences and I've used them at work in order to delve into a particular situation or user story. They've been surprisingly effective in communicating some aspect of a complex problem in a way that less technical, and more senior stakeholders can understand: they comprise a narrative that lets you tell the story of your design choice.

Essentially, a case study is a in-depth study of a particular situation. We can use this research design to examine how a design concept might work. They are very narrow (they can't be fit to all people), but they are also very flexible.

Case studies help you find situations that you didn't anticipate. They also help you see problems that you hadn't imagined.

The first thing you need to do for your case study (once your broader objective has been established) is to isolate to a particular population or sub-group.

Extrapolate a short list of points that you want to make and address. You will need these for clarifying the problem and linking to choice points in your design.

I would like to see your case study presented in something like a digital poster. (For example, you can compress down 2 or 4 slides onto one page.) So it should be succinct.

I'll talk about why I think this is an important deliverable in class; hopefully you will be able to use your case study to start our expand your design portfolio.
