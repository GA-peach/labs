# Case Study Design

## Summary

Your case study targeting behavior change should become a part of your portfolio.

**Your case study will tell a story about an insight you gained through ethnographic research, the challenge for your user segment, and how you intend to drive behavior change.**

You will use *empirical evidence and science to persuade your audience that your design solution would be effective*. Through this process, you will also have a portfolio piece that tell prospective employers about how you think and work when solving a design problem.

## Purpose

Over the years, I've made informal study of the use of case studies in industry. Here are some examples:

### Business and Law

In a practical sense, case studies have been used for *teaching* for more than a century. If you can imagine Hollywood's rendering of law school, often scenes focus in on argumentation around specific cases (okay, I'm a fan of *Legally Blonde*). Cases, in this sense, are being used pedagogically. They are part of an *empirical research* tradition as we studied with *experimentation*.

**Observations are used to distill, illustrate, and understand principles and best practices.**

Case studies in this tradition can also be used to *compare* approaches or methods.


#### Marketing

Marketing case studies are designed to show a potential customer how their product adds value in concrete terms by **showcasing** their work. I think also, these case studies are designed to help their customers *imagine* how services might integrate into their own strategy. Regardless, they are intended to influence and persuade potential customers to engage.

### User Experience (UX)

Recently, [interaction-design.org](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/ux-case-study) posted a series on "UX Case Studies". The primary purpose conveyed is for career development: tell a story about how you the designer solved a problem and the process you took to get to your solution.

Ultimately, the purpose for this sort of case study is for showcasing your own work and giving prospective employers insight into how well you communicate and skills you bring to the table. As with a marketing case study, you want the prospective employer to *imagine* you as a member of their team.

 ## Social Science and YOu

 We're going to be more precise about what your case study should accomplish; you will create a *behavioral design* case study.

The origin of the tradition upon which we will draw comes from the *social sciences* and these are often focused around *discovery*. Your case study can be thought of as a design method into which we incorporate an ethnographic research design.

**Typically, case study research in this tradition closely examines a person, or two or more (if comparative), that help illuminate issues about previously hidden behaviors or behavioral trends within a context.**

In a sense, this represents a bottom-up process of thinking. That is, you should approach observation in a theory-neutral manner. Remember, [Elizabeth Stokoe](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Elizabeth+Stokoe) talking about how conversation analysts focus on patterns of behavior but stop short of trying to explain it?

*You will invite theory (the how and the why) when it comes to talking about your solution and why we should believe your solution is well-founded from a scientific perspective.*

Recall how interaction design borrows from other research traditions ([IAs are like Robin Hood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXUKdMRkFCA))? We are adapting a method for a behavioral design case study that fills a gap in our toolbox of methods.

 Case studies are surprisingly flexible and effective for communicating some aspect of a complex problem in a way that less scientific / technical, and more senior stakeholders can understand: they comprise a narrative that lets you tell the story of your design choices in the medium of behavior.

## Structure

At a high-level, the structure of your case study is a story. I think of it as a [hero journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey) where your hero (subject) faces an unsurmountable obstacle and is transformed. We'll talk more about narrative structure later, but this should be your top-level view for now.

I have created a template for you to use in order that you piece together all the parts you will need for your narrative. This is a behind-the-scenes tool for you to structure your thinking.

The template scaffold captures information you will need for developing your final presentation. Just as we treated "reading scientific papers" as a separate exercise from "presenting scientific papers", we will do the same with your case study. The key difference here is that the template outlines elements of your thinking and strategy, while your poster will tell a story.

The table below illustrates template elements with some embedded notes. Your goal is to fill in the second column and perhaps include notes for yourself (or me) in the third.

| Template element | Fill this out | My notes (replace with your own, if desired) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Problem | | Continue to revise your concept into a succinct paragraph that serves as a summary of your user, the behavioral challenge, and your objective. |
| User Segment | | Define our user segment as per lab 4b, but also feel empowered to mention or reference a broader audience. |
| Insight | | What is your chief insight regarding the challenge your user faces? |
| Behavioral Objective | | What behavior do what to affect? |
| Decision Points | | Your insight should translate to a concrete action or set of actions. Where does your user make choices you can affect? For your presentation, you may want to include visuals such as a sketch, mock-up, photo, interaction flow, etc. |
| Touchpoints | | Where do you have opportunity to message your user in order to reinforce or otherwise influence decision-making? |
| Feel | | What tone, character, or feel are you projecting to the user when you are messaging (either during the interaction and/or via other touchpoints)? |
| Empirical Evidence Supporting your Design Choices | | What scientific principle introduced from the body of literature studied in class should lead your audience to believe (or predict) that your user will be likely to follow the path you intend. |
| Evaluation | | What specifically could you measure (in a quantifiable way) that would allow you to measure whether or not your design is effective? |



## Process

The process for the rest of the class is to provide you think-space for working through your case study template. Here's how this should unfold:

- **You've already "committed" an initial concept.** This was important to do so that you don't waffle all semester and worry about an idea. Yes, you can still change it! There is no time-limit on this. You can change it at any point. Insights don't run on a schedule.
- **This week you will narrow and define a user segment.**
- After the break, you will give a short [**elevator pitch**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch) (generally, about 30 seconds) to the class. An elevator pitch is usually an answer to a question someone raises to you while traveling up or down in the elevator along the lines of, "so what are you working on?"
- Most of the upcoming labs will focus on some element of your template. Simply follow along and make updates to your case study as we progress.

After your ethnographic research, you may find that your concept has been upended such that you completely revise your idea. Or, if you are fortunate, you may simply gain new insights or deeper clarity. If so, that's great! Either way, simply make your updates and move on.

## Practical Exercise

Watch ["The nightmare videos of childrens' YouTube â€” and what's wrong with the internet today"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9EKV2nSU8w) presented by James Bridle.

Take your template and try to fill out what you can. Next week we will talk about "insights". See if you can identify an insight (as well as other elements that you think fit into this template) and we will compare notes next week.

## Deliverables

Your final case study will be delivered in two parts.

The first is the **template** which you will be filling out and building up on throughout the rest of this semester. Because everyone will work in a shared folder on GitHub, you have the potential to learn from each other as we go.

The second deliverable is the poster presentation at the end of class. You will create a physical (and digital poster) that helps you tell a story to others. This should be fun. We'll split the class in half and walk around hearing in each story in turn. This is very similar to actual conference and should give you the confidence to do this in the future.

Finally, you will not be writing up your case study as a narrative in this class. But I would strongly encourage you do, so you can include it with your poster as a part of your design portfolio or as a writing sample if you intend to apply to the PhD program.
