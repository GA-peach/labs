# Labs

Labs are new as of Spring 2019. These breakout topics are designed to focus on the "how" relating to topics in this class.

In some sense, this course is intended to be deeply reflective. The ostensible goal is learn how to use the hidden palette of human  behavior in UX design.

Some additional practical skills I hope you take away from this class include:

- Using GitHub to edit documentation
- Recognizing "Dark Patterns"
- Reading scientific papers
- Presenting a scientific papers
- Discovering the "hidden obvious" through ethnographic research
- Designing a behavioral case study
- Designing for persuasion
- Quantifying behavior
- Creating an engaging story
- Presenting a poster for a conference

Finally, I am working on a cheat sheet to help capture "levers" available to you in designing persuasive interactions. Stay tuned!
