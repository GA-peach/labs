# Ethnographic Research

For your case study, you will perform ethnographic research. My suggestion is to get this done by the end of Thanksgiving (or Spring Break if this is the Spring semester). Perhaps, make use of the holiday break to do this research.

The purpose of ethnographic research is several fold:
- Gain deeper understanding of your target user.
- Gain insight not possible from introspection or via other research.
- Check your assumptions. You will likely be surprised at what you learn!

For now, this is where you should be in the development of your case study:
1. **Consider a concept around behavior change.** Whether your concept is an existing process or behavior that is less successful than desired, or your concept is novel - you can start with a very general idea.
2. **Narrow to a relatively small user segment.** For example: homeowners in a given neighborhood, undergraduate students at a specific university, people caring for elderly parents in Maryland.
3. **Find one or two informants -- they could be family, friends, or colleagues who you can speak with and (ideally) observe in a physical context.** It may be that this is not possible. In this case digital observation may allow you to observe behavior where it is not possible in the physical world.

In ethnographic research, your goal is to develop insight. The difference between this method and other methods such as persona development, is that you are still in an open, exploratory phase in your thinking. **You are not designing a solution at this point.**

Ethnographic research is time-consuming, since it often means observation ranging from an hour to days or weeks. Don't go overboard. Learn what you need to learn in order to understand the behavior of your target user and what needs are not currently met. You should gain insight into their values and motivations along the way.

You can ask questions while observing, but take care not to lead the conversation. You want to understand your target user  as best possible, *from their own perspective.* You will need to gain rapport and let them talk. Try to understand why they behave in the what that they do. Often, you are looking for the invisible. **What can they NOT do and why?**

Given the chance, you should want to ethnographic research. You will become the expert on your users more than anyone else on your team. Businesses succeed or fail on the basis of having this understanding!
