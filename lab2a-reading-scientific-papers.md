# How to Read a Scientific Paper

This lab is all about how to read a scientific paper. Is it tough when you're not an expert in the field? Of course! So don't sweat the things you don't understand.

**Your goal is to seek out specific bits of information.**

Once you've done this, you should have enough for a common sense critique.

# Sample paper

We're going to walk through a sample paper ("When Designing Usability Questionnaires, Does it Hurt to be Positive?") in class.

In this paper, I've notated in ink points I extracted from the paper. But since I didn't know much about SUS before selecting this paper, I did a bit of online research after reading the abstract. You may not have to do this, but don't be concerned if you have to stop and look up some concept elsewhere.

## Background on the System Usability Scale (SUS)

While it is convention in the introduction of a paper to review relevant literature, when I selected this paper, I didn't know much about the SUS, as described. So I took the time to look at the author's references and also find something that I could review with little time and effort.

From this reference, I pulled a few basic facts that helped me to understand SUS. https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/system-usability-scale.html

A SUS consists of a 10 item questionnaire with five response options ranging from 'Strongly agree' to 'Strongly disagree'.

Example positively and negatively worded questions:
- I found the various functions in this system were well integrated.
- I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system.

SUS is considered an industry standard for system usability.

Based on research, a SUS score above a 68 would be considered above average and anything below 68 is below average.

> Since I didn't know much about SUS, I will expect that my audience doesn't either. These notes will be useful for presenting this paper to you!

## How to Read a Scientific Paper

Reading scientific papers may seem daunting. They have a **formal structure** and authors don't always write as clearly as they could. But they are all structured about the same. Your task for this review is to identify specific pieces of information in the paper you selected and consider the utility and/or strength of the evidence presented.

**Don't read your paper straight through, skim the structure first.**

If I decide to read the paper, I generally read the abstract, skim for structure, identify hypotheses, experimental method, experiments (including results), then review the discussion and introduction.

**Since your goal is to gather information from the paper, you will pull out information after you skim  that will cause you to focus on different sections as you go.**

The most important thing is to remain open-minded (skeptical, even) and not read too much into the study. It is part of a larger [research programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_program) that includes other work. As a reader, it can be difficult not to over-generalize results or take a single study as definitive proof of anything. To read critically, consider how choices the author made may have led to conclusions that are not generalizable.

### 1. Read the abstract carefully

What is the central research question addressed?
The answer to this question should be in the abstract. It should also be re-iterated somewhere toward the beginning of the paper. It will be helpful to find this, since abstracts are dense and you may need more information to fully understand what is meant.

Sometimes the central research question is not stated as a question but as a finding. That's okay.

I often skip straight to the **conclusion** after the abstract to see if it lines up or something illuminating is mentione.

### 2. Hypothesis

What is the hypothesis of a given experiment? And because there are often multiple experiments... see if you can tease out WHY the researchers needed to conduct multiple experiments. Since they are trying to rule out **alternative explanations** for their findings, you will want to make note of these alternative explanations. When you answer questions in your critique, you may come up with one the authors did not consider!

It's not possible to conduct a perfect experiment - but authors will try to provide as much evidence as possible to support their claim.

The sample paper has two hypotheses (H1 & H2 as I've indicated in the sample). These should link directly to the central research question.

### 3. What Kind of Experiment?

In other words, what was the research method? **For your critique, you can go with either "Experimental" or "Non-Experimental."**

Feel free to suggest an answer with more detail, but this is sufficient. Refer to [this week's lecture material and, in particular, the diagram from Gliner, Morgan, and Leech 2011, if you are confused](https://github.com/idia640/presentations/blob/master/week02/PITCHME.md).

Can you assess further?
  - Randomized experimental
  - Quasi experimental
  - Comparative
  - Associational
  - Descriptive

When you are looking at "methods", your job is made much easier if the authors explicitly call out that they are doing randomized selection of participants. Look carefully for the word '**random**'. As you could see from the sample paper, it's possible the authors do not call it out. For this reason, I had to read this section closely and make my own judgement. I concluded that they researchers were comparing two groups of randomly selected individuals, but there were some un-answered questions (worth critiquing) which I commented on in the margin.

## 4. What are the Conditions and Variables?

At this point, I'm going to admit that I don't usually read the experiments carefully in terms of conditions and variables unless it's an important paper I want to understand well. But we're going to assume that it is so you gain practice at this.

In the lecture material, we talk a bit about the null hypothesis versus an alternative hypothesis. **In this paper, the null hypothesis is that there no difference in extreme response bias between Normal and Positive SUS.*

From the sample paper, there were two conditions (which I highlighted in red). The researchers compared a "Normal SUS" condition from a "Positive SUS" condition. (They also broke out even and odd questions.)

For the first hypothesis (concerned with acquiescence bias), the variable was the number of agreement responses (defined as scores of 4 or 5) across the two conditions.

For the second hypothesis (concerned with extreme response bias), the active variable was the number of extreme responses (defined as a 1 or a 5).

Something for you to consider, with respect to experimental conditions and variables. They should:
 - be stated clearly and unambiguously
 - fill a gap in knowledge
 - be testable
 - be ethical


The results of the experiment were anomalous leading the researchers to question their method and run a second experiment, which I'll mention in [lab 2b](https://github.com/idia640/labs/blob/master/lab2b-presenting-scientific-papers.md).

## 5. Results and Discussion

'Results' as a section header is self-explanatory. Sometimes they are mixed into the discussion. Which is fine, since the discussion section is useful for framing the work against previous work and expectations.

## 6. Introduction

Ironically, this is usually my favorite part. So even if the paper doesn't look interesting, I may read the introduction to see what other work is cited.

## Statistics

Don't worry about the statistics. But it won't hurt to recognize a few key things. For example,

- *N* = number of subjects
- *Mean* = average across respondants
- *SD* = Standard deviation tells you about the spread of responses. Are they are very similar, or do they deviate across a broader spectrum of answers?

## Common Sense Critique

After you've extracted the pieces of information you need for your critical review, consider these questions. You may want to go back to the paper, depending on the question.

> Do you think the study looked at enough people?

> How we subjects chosen? (Are they really random? Are they representational of the population in question?)

> Does the study measure what you think it measures? (e.g., if you are assessing happiness from tweets, does the use of "positive" words really reflect happiness?; construct validity)

> Do you think the experiment was reliable and would generally result in consistent results?

> Could other researchers reproduce these results having read this paper? (Imagine yourself as a researcher. How easy would it be to follow the 'recipe' (method) presented in the paper? Are there gaps?)

> Can you imagine any confounding variables the authors didn't mention?

> Do you think similar experiments in other contexts would produce the same results? (external validity)

> Do you think results would hold outside of laboratory conditions in other contexts? (ecological validity)

> Did the authors convey their message in a way that was clear?


 ## Insights

 Now step back out of the details of this paper. The paper you read should relate to the topic for the week. Since we won't get to that topic until later, you will want to think on these points later when you are thinking about [how to present your paper](lab2-presenting-scientific-papers.md) to the class. So just do what you can for the critical review assigment.

 > What is the significance of this paper?

 > Does it change your thoughts or has it introduced new ideas to you? In what way?

 > Can you imagine how insights from this paper relate to interaction design?
