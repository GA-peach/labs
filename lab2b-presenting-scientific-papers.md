# Presenting a Scientific Paper

Now that you understand some of the conventions around the structure of scientific papers and how to gather information from them in a critical reading, we're going to focus on presentation.

Here are a few tips:

- **Gauge your audience**. If you are not a scientist and doing a formal presentation of your own work, don't follow the structure of the paper. What do you think your audience is interested in understanding? Have the details ready for questions, but don't feel the need to share all of them. Since you have written a critical review, you will have these details in your hip pocket.
- **Understand the context**. This requires you to step outside of the paper a bit.
  - What is the over-arching question? Hint: This is rarely the specific hypothesis. Your view of this may be colored by your objectives and own approach toward presenting this paper.
  - Check https://scholar.google.com for a view of how the paper was received by peers. You will get a sense for highly cited the paper is. Look for recent work that may give insight into how the paper is currently viewed.
- **Tell a story.** Telling a story will require you to step outside of the article. This is where the introduction is useful. Sometimes you need to step back in time to understand the topic better.
- **Limit your use of visual aids.** That is, start with the message and the voice track and use the slides to convey concepts you can't easily communicate with words. Charts help to describe results, in some cases, but by limiting yourself to 1-3 slides, your story line may be more clear.
- **You are the teacher**. What do you want to teach us? Your presentation lines up with the topic for the given week. In fact, it's most often a reference drawn directly from the reading.
