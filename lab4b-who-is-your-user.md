# User Segmentation

How do you tailor an experience to the user? One way to start thinking about this is in terms of "user segmentation." The better you understand your user, the better you are able to tailer user experience. Because you will rarely have the opportunity to design for just one person or very small group, you will have to find ways to group, or segment, your users so you can focus on the needs of those that have similar needs, opinions/attitudes, values, and behaviors.

## Teams versus Individuals

First consider the *role* of a user in the real-world context and digital environment. That is, are you designing for someone who works as a member of a team in a specific role, or are you designing outside of a team-based context?

If your user is a **member of a team**, the importance of ethnographic research in the user's environment can't be over-stated. Go out and **observe your user in the context of work**, and if you have the opportunity, observe other roles, as well. Particularly, if you ultimately need a design that must meet the need of a team, as a whole. If the concept of the "hidden obvious" (remember the ethnographer [Ellen Isaacs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nV0jY5VgymI)?) applies anywhere, it is easily found in group dynamics.

In the real world (not this class), if you are concerned with designing for a team, you will want to use a variety of methods beyond ethnographic research such as task analysis, focus groups, and the development of personas.

Most of the material below pertains to the case of a single person model where you are **looking for similarity between individuals who interact with your design**.

## Segmentation

As with market segmentation, you may be concerned with either current users and *potential* users.

Start by thinking about whether there is a group that would have its own needs.
- How do you reach them?
- Are they likely to respond?
- Is it worth tackling this group at this point in your design?

How do you segment a population into segments when you do not have sophisticated analytical tools? Consider the following:

- **Demographic**: for example, gender, age, education, occupation, etc.
- **Psychographic**: for example, activities, attitudes, opinions, values
- **Geographic**: for example, region, city, locale
- **Behavior**: for example, are you focused on a group that shares a behavior in the sense of frequency, consistency, access, etc.
- **Events**: for example, are you focused around a specific event such as a festival?
- **Culture**: for example, are you interested in a group that is culturally distinct such as recent immigrants from a specific country?

While in this class you have no marketing data to start with, and perhaps no existing application, you should be able to tease apart groups by considering the criteria above.

## Use Case and Messaging

Once you've narrowed down to what you believe to be a viable segment, check to make sure that your proposed segment shares the same use case that you have in mind.

Also, consider where and how messaging will occur.

- If they are a segment, they are probably **reachable in common ways**.
- If they are a segment, they may broadly be a **part of a shared conversation or network** with one another.
- If they are a segment, **messaging and behavior should be correlated**. This means that when you engage with them (messaging in a UI, for example), you should expect similar responses.

Later, we will talk about the [idea of "audience architecture"](http://strategicsummit.com/using-data-to-segment-the-market-into-those-who-lead-those-who-share-and-those-who-lurk-and-learn/), but as a social organism, how people structure themselves in virtual space conversationally has bearing on messaging.

## Case Study

For your case study, if you have considered all of the above and believe you have a segment on which you will focus, you will be ready to move onto the next step in your case study design. Recall that later this semester you will want to do ethnographic research by observing someone who fits this user segment, so think about whether and how you might practically engage or observe someone who meets your criteria.

## Analytics

If you are fortunate enough to have a sophisticated customer relationship management (CRM) platform at work, you will ideally want to track user engagement over time. Are responses changing - perhaps, reflecting whether your user needs are changing or something in the digital context is changing? CRM platforms give you this visibility by building analytics into the platform and also tapping into social media and other channels.

If you don't have access to such tools, what do you do? Later in the course we will talk about measures that are quantifiable and give you the ability to measure the effect of design changes on your user population.

## Practical Exercise

I mentioned the app [trala](https://trala.com) in class and my recent user experience during a 7-day trial period. I was a middle-aged returnee to violin after about 30 years absence. As a user, I came with a solid foundational ability to play from  twelve years of study up until college graduation. My interest in the app was to recover lost skills and also learn to play fiddle music for jams. The particular technology promise of this app is real-time feedback on intonation and rhythm while playing a piece. This fills a real gap if you don't have a teacher who can give that feedback during lessons. But I experienced multiple frustrations using the app, because it didn't meet my particular needs (at least not yet).

When you look at this [design case study](https://www.erinmoore.design/trala-casestudy), see if you can determine the user segment the trala development team focused its efforts on. Your own case studies will be structured differently than this, and we'll talk more about that in the next lab.
