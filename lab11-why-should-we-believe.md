## Why should we believe your design is persuasive?

Yes, it's ironic that we're talking about persuading your audience that your design is persuasive. And yet, this is what you must do. You are selling an idea. And you want to give your audience a **reason to believe** that your design is sound.

The elements are simple:

- Tell a story. Ideally, one that has a personal connection (someone you know or have interviewed). If there is an **emotional** connection, it will likely be about your user.
- Describe the 'aha' or **insight** - remember back to story line from [lab5](lab5-insights.md)?
- Your presentation design itself should be **aesthetically pleasing** -- which should engender positivity towards your idea.
- Finally, you will present **scientific evidence** that indicates this is not just your opinion but that you have designed with cognition in mind.

As you review your template, consider the scientific evidence you will use and whether you think it is compelling for your case study.
