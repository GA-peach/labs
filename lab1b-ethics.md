# Dark Patterns

The dark patterns lab is here as a practice assignment.
https://github.com/idia640/Journals-Spring-19/blob/master/Practice-Dark-Patterns/Exercise.md

A comment I really like from "Dark Patterns" is: "Design is what mediates our interaction on the internet. It's the language we read it in. It's not too much to ask that we ask it to be comprehensible and honest."

Following this lab from the first week, we'll choose several examples from the class and have a short discussion on the topic of ethics and design.

If this is a topic, that interests you, check out some of the books on the syllabus. In particular, Thaler and Sunstein (2009) and more recent works you can find online, as well.
