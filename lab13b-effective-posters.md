## Designing Effective Posters

As we discussed in class, finding exemplars of posters that are painful on the eyes is easy. Particularly, those representing scientific work.

Consider your template as a scaffold for your design concept and use it to help you storyboard.

Elements you should include are:
- [User segment](lab4b-who-is-your-user.md)
- Summary problem
- [Behavioral objective](lab6-behavioral-objective.md)
- [User research](lab3-ethnographic-study.md) and [insights](lab5-insights.md)
- Your design
- [Scientific evidence that lends credibility to your approach](lab11-why-should-we-believe.md)
- [How you would measure success](lab12-effectiveness-of-your-design.md)

For this poster session, your **audience** are your peers in class.

The whole idea of posters is to capture the eye and generate interest and discussion. But as we've learned, most will be forgotten fairly quickly. So make your poster as **visually appealing** as possible and tell an **engaging story**. From this, your audience will hopefully remember you and something about your idea!
